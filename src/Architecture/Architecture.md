# Architecture
**OpenMPCC** itself consists of three major components, which interact with each other in order to enable highly scalable and secure Multi Party Computation.

The foundation of **OpenMPCC** consists of post quantum secure building blocks which can be leveraged to build post quantum secure MPC protocols.
With the MPC protocols as the second building block **OpenMPCC** is able to implement the privacy and security required for the collaboration of multiple parties.
The third and last building block, the confidential cloud, allows for the scalable deployment of MPC protocols while offering security and privacy from a hardware root of trust bridging the gap of the MPC protocols which assume that the execution environment is trusted.
